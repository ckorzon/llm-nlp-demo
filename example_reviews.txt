My family had a horrible experience at the White Fox Lounge last night! The food was way overpriced and our waiter took way too long to bring our drinks. Definitely would not recommend!

I had a wonderful meal at the White Fox Lounge recently, the steak was cooked to perfection and the desserts were to die for!

My wife & I visited the White Fox Lounge for the first time last night, and we'll definitely be coming back soon! The decor and music gave the place such a classy vibe, such great energy in there.
